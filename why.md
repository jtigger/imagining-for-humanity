# Why

A number of us have started dialoguing about what it would be like to do profit-making work ...
... but where the fundamental goal is the gratification and deep satisfaction of all involved.

We don't seem to organize ourselves in that way, naturally â€” the cultures in our modern society (particularly in "The West") has tended to yield groups who center around amassing wealth and power for a select few.

This sort of organization:
- **creates a disproprotionate amount of suffering** \
  We exchange tiny increments of fleeting "happiness" for a narrowing minority \
  for huge increases in persistent anxiety for the ballooning majority.
- **pulls us out of equilibrium with our environment** \
  We're destroying this planet by leeching its limited natural resources and billowing waste into the living spaces of other species
